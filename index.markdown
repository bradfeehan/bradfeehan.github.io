## Hi!

I'm Brad, a Software Engineer from Melbourne, Australia.

From a young age I've always had a passion for learning, exploring new
technology and understanding how things work. My keen interest in every
level of the tech stack motivated me to obtain a double degree, so I
could become qualified in both hardware and software.

I have over a decade of experience working on high-traffic web
applications, at different layers of the tech stack. Starting out in
full-stack web development, I found myself more engaged and excited
the higher the level of abstraction. I began focusing more on the
back-end, then picking up expertise in system administration, devops
and SRE principles.
